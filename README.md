## Quickstart guide
1. Install "Expo go" app on your mobile device (Android/IOS)  
2. Clone the repo into your desktop
3. cd to the project directory in terminal
4. run "npm install" in terminal
6. run "npx expo start -c" in terminal (Ensure you have the right react-native expo version (this project is using version 0.22.1)
7. scan the QR code that appears in the terminal (IOS users can use their camera app; Android user can use the camera inside Expo go app)
8. select "recipe-app" in the expo go app


## Remarks
1. I am using expo CLI for this assessment as it is much easier to setup the environment which allows me to focus on the development process.
2. AsyncStorage was used as the persistence method which will presist the recipe data across app restart
3. Multiple 3rd party libraries were used, e.g., Ionicons, DropDownPicker, AsyncStorage, and many more.
